3xnaa1	12/21/2015 01:33	sharkboy3210	Need Advice	this spring will be my first semester at tech doing me. little background, i've completed the first half of a dual degree program where i've been studying physics for the past 2.5 years and will receive a physics degree when i complete my me degree at tech.   anyways, i would really love to take on an internship this summer and get some engineering experience as soon as possible, but will employers be interested in a candidate who hasn't even completed a semester at tech. i've taken some engineering classes up to thermodynamics and dynamics of rigid bodies at my old college so i feel like i have some engineering value. what do you guys think? what actions should i take to open doors? thank you for your input!

Anyone here interested?	hey guys,  i have an opportunity for younger djs to play out on thursday night at a place on edgewood. this is an event that allows you to showcase your music and talent as a dj. it's not a huge party, it's more of an intimate setting with a crowd typically from 10-40 people. really depending on the night, thursday's are pretty volatile.  we've been doing this event for 2 years now and want to start bringing in younger talent. however i am having difficulties finding the talent since i'm a bit older and my friend group just doesn't have the young connects anymore!  i'm looking for more funk, house, techno, tech house, style djs. not looking for banging edm, hip hop, or indie music djs. even if your style may not fit in the above but you're interested reach out to me anyways with your sc or mixcloud and i'll take a listen.  i won't give out all the details about the event here but if you reach out to me i will provide more info.  thanks guys!

3vvua6	12/08/2015 03:49	boss1000	During finals week, I feel like it's worth being reminded that one test doesn't define you.	i always feel the energy drop and the stress levels rise during this time of year, even though i graduated a few years ago.  it totally makes sense. finals are important and worthy of your attention, as they can represent your mastery of the material presented in the last few months.  it may be useful to have pointed out, though, that these tests are just assessments of your understanding at a single point in time. you can learn what you missed after this week and still become a great professional despite tripping on diff eq or emag (or remag, 3mag...).  i don't know how widely this applies, but i took grades very personally and very seriously. my worth as a human being was in part defined by my gpa. that's not a good habit to have when classes get hard and you start getting cs.  so i found that framework of considering tests something that are quickly in the past and not representations of who i am today to be quite helpful. sure, yes, they form a small part of a number that determines your likelihood of getting that first job, but even that's not going to make or break your entire life. the long term is formed by everyday actions and learning.  this isn't meant to come off as some pep talk. it's just that i feel i would have benefitted from hearing something like this earlier than my last year. if you're someone who gets really wrapped around the axle during finals week, i hope maybe this means something to you.  good luck everyone.

3vrgfo	12/07/2015 06:49	AtlantaDogfighter	I've been having the strangest recurring dream as finals approach	i've been having a recurring nightmare, and it's been coming more and more frequently as my last week of finals approaches.  i awake covered in cybernetic implants, and i cannot remember anything. a scientist looks over me and flips a switch, "all systems, full power. i am your creator. you will now obey only me." my mind is numb, and i can barely remember who i am; i am under mind control; i can only focus on serving my new master, all my thoughts are directed only toward completing my next assignment.  the scientist removes me from his bench and orders me to compete against another robot in combat, he says the robot is my big brother. i defeat the robot, but i feel nothing. we are both allowed to serve on our master's latest project, but my brother is sent to a repair bench. as i see machines dismantle and repair this other robot, it feels as though these machines are torturing my brother.   the pain and guilt of seeing my own brother being dismantled and mutilated causes me to snap, and suddenly i remember who i really am. thoughts of my past life rush into my head as i remember my family and realize the other robot really is my brother. fear for my family overtakes me as i realize the rest of my family must be imprisoned and enslaved as well. i feel a new sense of purpose as i set out desperately to free my family from the cybernetics and break his mind control.  what does this nightmare mean?

3vpiiq	12/06/2015 21:41	ssh3p	Did anyone see what happened on Tech Parkway next to the SC?	i was walking by the sc and heard some tires squealing. there was a silver cuv (looked like a late 2000s infinity fx35) going towards north ave the wrong direction. they kept moving forward, forcing another car back up to nearly the little cement divider near guggenheim.  the driver who backed up got out of his car, started yelling at the cuv, and the cuv driver obviously tried to hit him. it looked like she cracked his bumper.  the cuv then did a really shitty 5 point turn, tires squealing, and flew down the side road by wells fargo. at this point, the dude who had gotten hit pulled onto the side street and got out to look at his bumper. then the crazy driver starts flying back down the side road in reverse, probably about 20-30mph. looked like she was intending to sandwich/kill the dude against the front of his car... he ran onto the grass, and the original driver slams the brakes and skids to a halt just in front of the stopped car. then she peeled out and flew up the road again, going eastbound on northave.  by the time i realized i should be calling gtpd, the first car was gone. did anyone else see this? should i file a report with gtpd? i didnt get the plates on either car. i've never seen anything like this before.....    edit: went to the station, they told me apd had responded and had several reports already. hopefully they can get this psycho off the road..

3vi7yy	12/05/2015 04:31	KunJVR	Regarding Transfer admission major choice and change major at GT as transfer student	i am a first year cs major at uga. i am planning on applying for the spring semester of 2016-2017 academic year. i will have around transferable credit hours by the document deadline.(32 from ap + 16 first semester + 15 second semester + 7 summer semester). i am interested in both computation media and computer science at gt. my question is should i apply for computational media for easier admission? under the assumption that i get in as computational media: if i don't like computational media after one semester, how hard will it be for me to change major to computer science? if i good grades after one semester, will it be guaranteed that i can change my major?  i found [college of computing major change request ](  http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/college-advising/application-change-of-major-form). however, it doesn't specify the any details.  lastly, grades at uga have +/- scales, how will this be converted when applying for transfer admission? for example, if i get all a- in all of my classes at uga(a- at uga is a 3.7), will gt reevaluate my gpa as 4.0?  i really appreciate any helps you guys can provide.

3vcuu5	12/04/2015 01:22	bryancopper	Cyber1 PLATO Community	tl;dr: there's a group of folks at cyber1.org who maintain an active plato system server, and if you join up(free), you can play some of the very first multiplayer crpgs and add some new vigor to the cyber1 community.  this post is mainly directed at computing nerds who are into nostalgia, and/or anyone interested in role playing games, whether tabletop or computerized.  the late 70's gave birth to some of the very first multiplayer rpgs on computer systems. uofi's plato system was the home of dungeon crawling games such as oubliette and avatar, games which were far ahead of their time in terms of multiplayer interaction. at night, when the computer terminals were open for casual use, college students would fill the game servers, meeting in taverns, forming parties, and raiding dungeons together.  now, almost 40 years later, this era of games still has a dedicated following. through emulation of a plato terminal, anyone can log onto a free, maintained server to revisit these game worlds or discover them for the first time. however, the volume of players frequenting the server is nowhere near as gargantuan as it once was. the plato community is very friendly and helpful, but it could use more members.  that being said, i'd like to encourage gatech's diverse and nerdy community to consider bringing extra life back to the plato community. cyber1 (cyber1.org) hosts an active server and provides a plato terminal emulator called pterm. if you're interested, head over to their site, do a little reading, and request a signon. they'll confirm your request within a week. you then download pterm, boot it up, and dive into the world of early early computer gaming.  seriously, go check it out. it could be a fun way to spend winter break if you get bored, and it would be super sweet to see a whole bunch of tech students nerding out on an ancient of days computing system.  *disclaimer* i'm not affiliated with cyber1 besides owning a signon, i just really dig this niche of computing.

3tzvur	11/23/2015 21:55	csquestion4u	Question for CS Majors: If I have a great idea for a startup, what's the best way to position it to garner highly qualified people to design the website and app?	i have a great idea but lack a tech to put it in action. upon looking more into it, i see many people with startup ideas seeking techs. i don't want my great idea to be overlooked as just another mundane project.  edit: thanks to all responders. even those who ridicule me as a business minded nontechnical person who's out of his league. and special thanks to those going out of their way to pm helpful notes.  i honestly chose this platform as a source for helpful insight on obtaining a tech(s). but with the few interests i've received, it may be useful to use this to forum to solicit.  first off, i am a very diligent business minded individual. the goals i set very seldomly go unaccomplished. and of those ventures unaccomplished, lessons were learned that actually opened doors to a larger unforeseen success at a later time. i'm very proud of what i've accomplished this far in life, and i am nowhere near finished in my successes.   as brilliant as i am in business, i aspire of another as a tech. i think the mesh of these two worlds will be colossal. i'm looking for a partner(s).   as far as the idea, all i'm willing to say on the internet is that as far as keys to a successful venture, this idea meets them all. it creates a cheaper service than what presently exist and is more efficient. the plan combined with a knowledgeable tech who can effectively design it as an easy to use program is what's missing.  again. i'm business minded and understand what is reasonably expected by a tech. terms of our partnership will be fair to all parties involved from the very beginning. i don't intend to sell the tech only on hopes and dreams that should the venture fall short, the tech(s) leave empty handed with nothing but lost time to show. i'm reasonable and looking for reasonable partners.  for those who plan to trash me. i don't blame you. but understand that in no way will it discourage me from my endeavors. believe me, i've overcome enough obstacles to know that any worthy goal will come with critics. and only a fool will succumb to the critics. and a smart person doesn't disregard critics completely. sometimes there are useful points to consider.  thanks again to all readers who have taken the time to read my post. and if further interested, pm me.  thanks

3tzg7v	11/23/2015 20:17	arandomruski	Bit of advice on choosing a major	i am a graduating senior and as i'm getting ready to finally get out of this place i thought i would share a bit of wisdom on choosing a major and the value of your education. anyone looking to come to tech, especially if you are not dead set on a mainstream engineering major, should read this.  i think that whether or not georgia tech is a worthwhile investment boils down to two factors. whether or not you are in the right major, and whether or not you are able to copiously cheat (aka have the word).   from my 4.5 years experience here i have come to understand that apart from a few engineering majors, specifically mechanical engineering, cs, electrical, industrial, and civil, no other major has much of a demand straight out of college. there are simply not enough jobs. according to the american chemical society 15% of bachelors of science are unemployed, and of those who are employed the average wage is 30k. for comparison, my family paid 250k for this degree out of our life savings so if i were to land a chemistry job it would take me a decade of savings just to break even on the cost of education.  theoretically speaking, if i were to go on to get a phd in chemistry i would be decently well off with a 60k average salary. the problem with this is that it would require another 2-4 years of schooling (opportunity cost) as well as a gpa above 3.0. that is the real catch since the average gpa in the chemistry program is 2.7. statistically speaking over half of the department is not qualified for phd programs and can only go for masters, which boasts an impressive 23% unemployment rate for being overqualified for bench work and under qualified for project management. of those who do get over 3.0 many are cheating profusely. i've seen entire analytical chemistry lab reports, which average out at about 10 hours of work each, pulled out of fraternity archives, slightly edited, and "finished" in a bit over an hour. the same rabbit from a hat trick can be pulled for exams which change little from year to year.  the only reason why i managed to land a 55k/year job, after an exhaustive job search which took 5 months, hundreds of applications, and dozens of interviews, is because i took classes at my local university as well as online to teach myself to code. its a very sick sort of irony, but two basic programming classes and a pair of internships where i essentially made my own coding projects got me a 55k a year job with real growth potential while 4.5 years of tech's chemistry program for 250k could at best get me a lab monkey job that pays pennies.  for short, in case this wasn't obvious enough, do not come to tech for anything other than mainstream engineering.  data to prove my point: http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i26/new-grad-salaries-employment.html find course gpa's here: try chem 3111 or chem 3380 for average difficulty chem grade results https://critique.gatech.edu/

(at least pdfs) * quickly search assignments and announcements for all of your courses * ... and more!  if you are interested in a hands-on demo, i will be at gvu demo day at tsrb, probably in the app lab (room 333).  it can be found in the google play store: http://goo.gl/8jyjg8  an ios version has been developed (and is my primary development platform, actually), but we haven't gone through the app store paperwork process yet.  t-square is a fickle beast and i am not able to test for every combination of class out there.  i know that ta and instructor views are buggy, but there may be other issues.  there have been issues with some older android devices as well.

3rzdxo	11/08/2015 06:56	GTsurvivorAMA	I am a Georgia Tech rape survivor. Ask me anything.	**i am a survivor of rape on georgia tech campus.**    you just read that sentence.  about 20% of you think, wow.  that must be hard.    the other 80% of you think, prove it.  for many on campus, the gruesome details of reported assaults are what make them legitimate.  you need to know what i was wearing.  you need to know if the sex was oral, vaginal, anal.  you need to know if i screamed.  you need to know if bled.  you need to know if my mother cried.  you need to know if my boyfriend ever had sex with me again.  you need to know if my rapist was sorry.   it pains me to have to tell you that youa population of intelligent, bright peopleare not entitled to that information.  i wish i could give it to you.  i wish all true survivors could tell their stories and gain the credibility they so deserve in the public eye.  but life isnt fair.   so i just lost about half of that 80%.  life isnt fair?  thats her point?  yeah, no shit.  hold on with me for  a second.  the world is full of terrible peopleliars and rapists alike.  these labels are harsh.  painful to give and to receive.  but that is the job of some on this campus.  and unless any of you reading this are appointed faculty, that isnt you.    (im losing a half of that half right nowhang on.)  i deeply believe in the rights of students to voice their concerns about osi.  i have my doubts about the phi delt case.  i think theres a good chance those guys completely got the shaft.  and that sucks.  and maybe that poor judgment has been applied to a handful or even a dozen sexual misconduct cases on campus.  but we, as a community, cannot put the failures of an office on the head of one student, whom few of us actually know.  if any of you are monty python lovers, youll remember the famous scene in the holy grailwhen the witch is tried for well, being a witch i guess.  the townspeople want to burn her so badly, they go so far as to put a false nose and witchs cap on her.  (someone also lies about being turned into a newt, but thats besides the point.)  she attests to the magistrate that she is simply a normal woman, a victim of circumstancebaring her real nose in the process.  and everything about it is completely ridiculous, thats what makes it so funny.  no one can prove she isnt a witch and she provides no proof of her innocence.  she is eventually carted off-screen to be burnedcompletely and totally fucked.  the audience doesnt think of her again except as the punchline to a legitimately excellent joke.   the girl mentioned in last weeks technique article is that woman from monty python.  she has been asked to defend herself in a ridiculous manner in the middle of a ridiculous circumstance.  and you cannot blame her if she doesnt want or even know how to participate.  student newspapers are cool thingsmade to unite, bond, and compel students.  but, at the end of the day, they were never intended to cause harm and more importantly alienate one girl.    i do not know if she lied.  none of us really know.    as much as our school should be a place of inquiry and education, it should also exist as a community filled with compassion and acceptance.  for everyone involved.  we, the students of georgia tech, are surrounded by uncertainty within this case.  was she raped?  did she lie?  is he okay?  is she?  **i beg you, look into your hearts to find sympathy for everyone involvedincluding the alleged victim.**  reserve judgment and leave these poor people out of it when seeking truth from the office of student integrity.  details aside, everyone is suffering and justice was not done.  that man was a peer and friend.  this girl is someones daughter.  when you take away the labels, when you dont pick a liar and you dont pick a rapist, all that is left are lives in shambles and immeasurable pain.  **i will be conducting a gt ama on the comments section of this post.**  i will respond to all questions about the osi process and my opinions on the technique controversy.  out of respect to my friends, family, and rapisti will include no identifying comments about my assault.  because life isnt fair.  *hit me with your best shot.  im ready to provide answers.*  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  **edit: november 8th: still plan to answer questions, but waiting on the mods to look over documents i sent in.  when they say i'm legit, i'll respond.**  from one mod: "i've reviewed the additional documents provided and am going ahead and marking this as verified. in verification, i believe we've reached the point that, without her identifying herself or someone breaking ferpa, and at the same time i can be certain of the veracity of her claims. there's not a whole lot of elaboration i can provide. do be aware that i'm not verifying this lightly."  (available in comments)  **edit: november 11th: gonna log out of this reddit and call this ama over.  people were really a lot more respectful than i expected and i'm proud of the conversations we had.  thanks to everyone for the kind and engaging discussion about student issues on gt campus.** if you need more information, i recommend you do your research on title ix, the currently debated safe campus act, and the gt sexual misconduct policy.  i do not represent these organizations, but pause, voice, and the women's resource center are also available.  they come with their own biases--but they're certainly available.  thanks guys!

3rf8h8	11/03/2015 23:50	theIntroverttt	Transfer Student Help	hey everyone, i am a florida resident looking to transfer to gt.   i have some questions about transfer requirements in case anyone had any information.   my major is computer science, and i see 2 lab sciences are required, so i plan on taking chem 1 and 2 at my school (valencia college). but when looking at the transfer equivalency chart at: https://oscar.gatech.edu/  my chem 1 class transfers into 1211k at gt, and my chem 2 class at valencia college transfers into 1310 at gt. when i went to the campus info tour, i remember hearing about how 1310 satisfies both requirements for lab sciences and just need to know if this is true, since i remember vaguely.   also one last thing, one of the recommended courses is linear algebra. my college doesn't offer that course, or at least not one that satisfies the gt requirements. is missing one recommended transfer course a big deal? i am taking physics 1 which is also recommended.  i have a 3.8 gpa currently and a 4.0 in math and science. and hope to have all the requirements and all recommended courses done by next fall (minus linear algebra). are these good grades and stuff for acceptance?   thanks a lot in advance for any help.

3psze6	10/22/2015 18:31	ogfromjc	Block Seating - Time for a Change	hear me out. i am a member of greek life at tech, and as much as i love being able to sit with all of my friends, i think it's time to make our student section great. i think we need to  change the way our block seating is structured.  first, i think the area where students block should not be changed. it makes sense to reward groups that show up to games with better seats, and the area of the stadium that we are in is perfect. second, i think we should group sections as a block that several groups are in. i think there should be no clearly defined end and beginning of blocks within the sections.  lastly, i think we need to extend blocks to include sororities - they should be rewarded for attendance as well. blocks could also change for each game based on previous attendance and possibly other criteria like gpa, but that is a change that could occur later.  here's an example of what this could look like: section 115 closest to the field includes block seating for three or four different organizations (fraternities, sororities, and the like). however, there would not a strict row cutoff between each organization's block. this would mean that, of those groups who are wearing wristbands that  say section 115 lower, the people that show up earliest have the chance for the seats closest to the field. it would encourage a higher level of attendance and punctuality among all students in that block, and it would reduce arguments over the end of one block and the start of another.  let me know what you think. this is a preliminary thought that i want students' interest in before taking the next steps. obviously, nothing immediate can change, but i do think a change needs to happen eventually. my only hope is to boost the atmosphere in the student section for home games and to establish bobby dodd as a stadium where other teams are afraid to play. thanks!
3psreb	10/22/2015 17:38	BellaMentalNecrotica	How difficult is pre-med at GA Tech? Is GA State the better option?	i am a 25 year old who just made the decision to become an md. i graduated from vcu in 2012 with a music degree, had a 3.94 undergrad gpa, won lots of awards and went there on a full ride. i am currently training to be an emt here in atlanta to get some clinical experience.  anyway, i'm trying to apply for fall 2016 to do my med school pre reqs. i plan to apply for a second bachelor's degree and dropout once i have all the requirements. i've narrowed my list to three schools:  georgia tech  georgia state  virginia commonwealth university (my alma mater-safety school)  out of georgia tech and georgia state, which one will give me the best chances of a shot at med school? i should note that i would like to go into academic medicine and therefore, would like to apply to some top 10's for actual medical school, so take that into consideration.  i have a 3.94 undergrad gpa right now. i know georgia tech is famous for low gpas. if i went to tech, i would not do engineering, however, just regular bio. is the science department still hard as far as gpa? or is that just the engineering department? tech is a better school and has better research access. i really want to go to a school that has good research opportunities considering i want to do academic medicine. tech would probably also better prepare me for the mcat. but i also don't want to risk my gpa. i want to maintain the good gpa that i already have.  i looked into emory, but they do not allow students who are going for a second bachelor's. i'd rather not do non degree seeking because you get last pick of the classes.  i have a better chance at maintaining my current gpa at georgia state, but their access to research isn't as good and they aren't as good of a school. will going there hurt me when applying to med school? especially for top 10's?  any techies here who were/are premed have any input? considering my situation, which would be a better fit for me? i'm leaning towards doing bio at tech, but i'm just so worried about losing my good gpa. thanks in advance!!

3po5ue	10/21/2015 19:07	None	Advice from other transfers?	i'm looking to transfer to tech in fall 2016 from the university of pennsylvania. i'm planning on applying as an nre major, with mse as my second pick (i was an mse major at penn). nre isn't offered at penn, so that's my #1 reason for wanting to transfer. #2 is that i'm really passionate about engineering, and i felt like most penn students weren't. i want to be at a school that actually cares about engineering.  i have all of the required classes (and all of the "recommended" ones) for both majors i'm considering because i took 18 credits first semester, and 21 the second. thing is, taking 21 credits was stupid, and because i also had a lot of personal issues stressing me out, i wound up with a c in linear algebra, which tech wouldn't have offered me credit for anyway. my gpa dipped to a 3.30.  besides that one mistake, i think i'm a strong candidate - i applied as a freshman and got in early (should have gone then, damn it!) how forgiving do you guys think they would be? i've explained my situation to a few faculty at tech (in nre and mse, not admissions) and they encourage me to go for it.   **tl;dr: i took way too many classes last semester, then personal issues came up and i did poorly in one that luckily wasn't required for admission. did i screw myself over?**  edited: spelling mistake

[add a reference to the petition while you're at it.](https://www.change.org/p/dr-g-p-bud-peterson-independent-investigation-into-allegations-against-phi-delta-theta-at-georgia-tech?recruiter=407300911&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink)   *** edit ***  okay, turns out i did get an update. they said, surprise surprise, that it didn't really get addressed. they urged me that the best way forward is, again, to bring this up with the nique. tell them to question why the issues sga chooses to address are so subjective - that the fight song got a poll (70% against the change, by the way) and this has yet to receive even a comment. they said in particular to discuss the ongoing issue with osi and continuing tensions regarding student-faculty relations.   *** edit 2 ***  **to any sga members who may have seen this and are currently furious: if it's a big enough deal for you to be mad about it, it's a big enough deal for you to be talking about it.**

3peh9t	10/19/2015 20:54	G-P-Burdell	Petition for State Investigation into OSI's Handling of Allegations Against Phi Delta Theta	i think there is a pretty broad consensus that osi has badly mismanaged the investigation into the allegations against phi delta theta. this is a petition for students to sign asking for an impartial investigation by the attorney general's office of georgia into the whole situation and how it was handled. i feel like this is the best way to handle the problem, so let's get the word out:  https://www.change.org/p/dr-g-p-bud-peterson-independent-investigation-into-allegations-against-phi-delta-theta-at-georgia-tech?recruiter=407300911&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink  please share/upvote/email/facebook and get the word out! we want the administration to take notice that we, the students of one of the best universities in the world, don't feel that this thing was handled fairly and impartially, and that we're not going to sit idly by while osi tramples on people's rights.  edit:  here is a link to the news article about the situation: http://www.11alive.com/story/news/local/downtown/2015/10/15/suspended-ga-tech-fraternity-denials-racial-slurs-allegations/74017350/  and a link to another /r/gatech post about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/3ozmy1/phi_delta_theta_says_the_racial_slur_allegations/  fyi: this is a text repost of what was previously a link post, i wanted to make sure that the links are at the top of the page.

(all taken from the center for research on violence against women at uky)  what does that mean...like 6ish% (?) of all the accused are found to be guilty?  that 2% statistic is pretty damn good, and all of these statistics show that our legal system works.   however, i don't believe we can assume that universities exercise the same level of prudence and strict adherence to policy, that we see in the judicial system.
3pdi6t	10/19/2015 17:07	TheRealRobMonty	Gauging Interest in a FIRE Chapter at Georgia Tech	in light of the recent developments with osi, i have become interested in the possibility of founding a [fire](https://www.thefire.org) chapter at georgia tech. fire is the foundation for individual rights in education and basically exist to oppose the kind of miscarriages of justice that osi is apparently perpetrating on a regular basis now. given what has happened, the need to protect our rights is more important than ever.  by forming a fire chapter, we would gain access to resources, speakers, and assistance from people whose job it is to help us protect our rights. georgia tech currently has a [red rating](https://www.thefire.org/schools/georgia-institute-of-technology/) on fire's website, the worst possible ranking for how much freedom of speech we have. by taking actions such as petitions, informing alumni, and encouraging a spotlight on such dark and secret actions we could help make georgia tech a freer place for all.   i'm currently waiting to hear back from fire but in the meantime i'm looking to gauge how much interest there is for such an organization. i'm also looking for someone who might be willing to serve as a faculty advisor. if you think this is something you might be interested in, or if you think you or someone you know might be a good fit for the advisor position, please let me know in the comments. additionally, if you would like me to keep you updated, feel free to pm me with your name and email and i will keep you in the loop.   right now no one is standing up for us. no one organization is making efforts to oppose osi's extremely aggressive and secretive policies of guilty-until-proven-innocent. i want to change that and i hope that with the help of the georgia tech community we can affect that change.

3paod9	10/19/2015 01:08	riderinvesting	Questions about math major going into finance	hi everyone,   i'm a sophomore transferring to georgia tech in the fall (from georgia state), and am considering pursuing an applied math major to go into finance. i'm looking into some combination of an applied math major and economics minor (or major) or vice versa because i'm very interested in the quantitative research side of finance (analytical research for hedge funds, banks or trading companies). i'm heavily interested in both math and economics, but am considering math since i think it will be the most applicable to my future career, and provide more options (of interest to me) upon graduation.    i have read several posts on this reddit and other sites about math majors at tech, but most of the posts relate to going into cs or engineering as a math major. if any applied math majors or people with experience in finance from ga tech would be willing to help out, i have a few questions:   * if there are any math majors that plan to go into finance or are working in finance, would you mind sharing your experience?  * what types of resources does the college of sciences have to help me secure a job in finance? i know scheller and ivan allen might be more geared towards this, but does the college of sciences also provide networking and job opportunities in finance?  * what would be the impact of double majoring (math and econ) vs a major + a minor? other than obviously graduating later, is there any clear benefit to doing a double major?  * what would be some good classes to take for my first semester at georgia tech to 'get my feet wet' while keeping my gpa intact (i will be transferring into tech with calc 1 & 2 credits, but no linear algebra). i'm aware that it will be a huge transition to tech, so i plan to take mostly econ classes for my first semester. * how applicable is the education from a math major to quantitative research in finance (investments, business analysis, etc.)? from what i've heard from industry professionals, most majors don't prepare you for a finance job, is math an exception?  * how does an applied math degree at tech position me for masters/phd programs in math/economics or for mba programs?  * i plan to participate in the lse study abroad program, has anybody done this, how did it go? * what clubs/organizations should i join that involve math and finance at tech? i already plan to join the gt student foundation investments committee, but are there any other clubs like this?   i know that this is alot to ask for, so i greatly appreciate any help that you could provide. thanks!  edit: to provide some clarification

3ov9yy	10/15/2015 15:37	dfsdfffdg	To the racial minorities (read: not white) Tech students:	i've realized lately that the vast majority of the examples of racial discrimination i know of fall into one of the following few categories. i challenge all of the racial minorities on this subreddit to give me an example that doesn't fall into one of them.  (disclaimer: i'm not claiming that racism doesn't exist. i'm just trying to learn. please don't demonize me for trying to learn.)  1) hearsay. a mother, father, friend experienced the racism, not the person communicating the racism to me.  2) "subtle micro-aggressions" that cannot really be said to be discriminatory one way or the other. my example isn't of racial discrimination, but rather of the gendered type. most of the interns at my summer internship were men; if i had to guess, i'd say a ratio of 6:1. most of the full-time, non-support staff were men as well; maybe 2:1.  i was eating lunch with some of my fellow interns one day, and there was one woman intern at the table. we got on the topic of machine learning, and she had a few questions and made a few points about the specific topic we were discussing. truth be told, the conversation made me kind of uncomfortable. she seemed to be getting more and more agitated, and i wasn't exactly sure why. later that evening, she made a long, ranting facebook post about how all of her opinions and thoughts were being appropriated by the men, using this specific lunch conversation as her primary example. she concluded her cringey post with, "today, i hate all men."   now, i remember at this conversation that the interns were repeating a lot of the same thing. but i put it down to just poor communication. i thought her ideas were being repeated by the men because they wanted to make sure they understood. apparently, that's not the way she saw it.  my point is, she can't claim with certainty that she was being disregarded because she was a woman. she can't convincingly say that there was discrimination. i'm not even totally convinced she was disregarded. these kinds of awkward conversations happen all the time.  **this isn't to say that no examples of subtle-microaggressions are acceptable. i just can't think of any that are actually convincing.**  3) fear, without convincing discrimination. a good example would be black people's fear of cops. you can feel afraid without there being any real threat. i feel afraid whenever there's an inexplicable bump in my room at nighttime.   **this isn't to say that black people shouldn't be afraid of cops. i'm saying that fear, in and of itself, is not a very good example of racism. i want real, tangible, specific examples.**  4) shouts on the street. i frequently get "faggot" shouted at me whenever i wear a brightly colored sweater. (and i'm straight.) a shout on the street might ruin your day, but it's not a very good example of systemic, oppressive racism. at worst, it's just extremely rude.  thanks!

3o6oes	10/10/2015 04:25	TryingToFindZen	So I took a co-op at a start-up company... and got TOTALLY SHAFTED. What do I do?	tl;dr below.  i turned down two secure co-ops for the risk of diving into a start-up company. the ceo who interviewed me explained as one of the few engineers in the company i'd have virtually limitless opportunities to make large, visible impacts on the company and build a powerful resume on impressive accomplishments. he told me by the end of my co-op (summer and fall 2015), i can potentially hold multiple patents in my name under supervision of the head engineer, and will attain a plethora of business knowledge from direct mentoring under the ceo. he gave me quite the speech. two days later i accepted and turned down my other opportunities.  here's the cliff-notes version of what happened instead. first a minor detail: job description says the company is in a city 30 minutes from my home, awesome. however, they didn't mention i'd actually be working in the ghetto desert butt hole of my state 90 minutes from my house, where there's no air conditioning or mobile data/wifi. co-op starts in early may first monday after finals. it's now two weeks into october, and after months of being blown off when i asked for assignments, ignored when i proposed projects of my own, and shut down when i offered alternative solutions to problems the head engineer was working with, i'm pissed off. i'm not a guy that gets angry, but i'm having a tough time keeping my cool. what was i doing the whole time, then, you ask? bitch work at the manufacturing facility with the temp workers, of course! (in the 100 degree heat under a tin-roof with no a/c, no internet access, and a daily 3 hours of commuting time, of course!)  so i call the ceo and ask we speak about my co-op. he says we'll talk, but instead meets with the douchey dismissive head engineer first. the douchey engineer tells the ceo he's given me tons of assignments, but instead i've been doing everything i can to blow them off and escape responsibility. the douchey engineer tells me that the ceo and him decided to withhold my pay raise (my co-op contract with them says i'd get a pay raise starting the fall term, so they totally can't do that) until i finish "the assignments he gave me". of which there are none. i ask him what in the fuck he wants me to do, and of course, being a vague asshole, (sorry for the steady increase in foul language. it's necessary.) he essentially says nothing. standing there all smug with this awful douchefag grin on his face. this happened today. i'm livid. he made me out to be the bad guy with no intention other than to save his own ass, and after all of this i still don't have the opportunity to prove myself. i'm out.  my question: if i bail on this co-op, which i know will void this co-op term and will list it as a "w", will this remove me as a full-time student where i'll have to reapply to tech?  i can't just take a hiatus, i'm sure tech has rules against that. if i can find another employer to take me in for the rest of the term (of which i is a possibility. it's a friend of a friend.), am i not allowed to do that?  any help is appreciated!  tl;dr co-op promised me kickass opportunities, and not only did they break all of the promises, but also kept me from learning anything or working on any projects. if i quit halfway through a term, will i get shafted by tech too?  edit: cc'd boss + emailed douche. calling co-op advisor in a bit. thanks for the help guys.

406tcd	01/09/2016 16:11	eviscerator88	Reposted with update: The 10 things I did this semester to turn my grades around from academic dismissal to dean's list	originally posted 1 year ago:  "i failed out of georgia tech. twice.  i was lucky enough to be let back in for one last chance this semester. it took me shamefully working a year delivering pizzas for me to finally learn what i needed to do to succeed.  it takes hustle.  1 hustle  i was fortunate like many tech students to not have to try in high school. that doesnt work here. you actually have to put in the work to get the results. that means showing up. that means doing the boring reading and taking notes. that means staying off your phone during lecture. that means doing things differently. i used to game and drink way more than i would sit and work homework problems. if you want to succeed you have got to be willing to work yourself harder than ever before and earn those grades. believe me, it is so worth it at the end after the struggle when you succeed, because you worked for it.  2 campus resources  did you know you can meet with a therapist for free on campus? did you know they have tutoring 1 on 1 in specifically your subject, for free? i didnt take advantage of these things when i needed them most, and most people dont even know they exist. take advantage of the counseling center, 1 on 1 tutoring, plus tutoring, workshops, reboot, academic coaching, and even your adviser. i went to 2-3 of these things weekly and met with my adviser and coach every 2 weeks. its a great way to get some strategies and skills you can actually use and to just be held accountable so that you stay on track.  3 office hours  i started thinking i was just paying overpriced tuition for a piece of paper that says i graduated, because you can get all these textbooks and information online now with all these universities releasing their curriculums. realize what sets going to college apart is your access to your professors. going to office hours or even just staying a bit after class gave me an edge, because i could get information on the material (and the upcoming exams) from the source. i made sure my professors knew me by name so that when giving grades out came around, they would bump me up those extra few points. it works. plus, now youll have professional relationships that can always help you out when youre job hunting.  4 cut down on drinking/smoking/partying  you know its hard to get anything done when youre hungover. and memorizing stuff never works so well after a joint. if youre going to succeed, you need to cut down at least while youre hustling. your brain is an organ like any other in your body and youve got to recognize that it doesnt work optimally when youre intoxicated, and youre going to need it to work at full capacity. i went hardcore and got completely sober for the semester. find what works for you and stick to it.  5 motivate yourself  you know how whenever you hear that one song you get super pumped? why not mindhack yourself and use it to your advantage? i have a youtube playlist of speeches, songs, etc. that i know will get me motivated when mixed with some caffeine. put this motivation survival kit together for yourself for that time in the semester when you know youre going to want to skip class. this motivation survival kit saved my ass literally over a dozen times this semester.  6 dont miss class  the more class you miss, the worse your grade will be. its been statistically proven. you know this. i used to only go to 5 classes the entire semester, 4 of which were exams. even when your professor bores you to death, you can at least spend that time teaching yourself out of the textbook. create some kind of accountability to force you to go. i made a rule that i would have to email my professor with why i missed class each time, and that really made a difference.  7 start everything early  the first time i had a homework done 3 days before it was due was the most relieving feeling i cant describe. instead of having to stay up late scrambling last minute, i could spend that night having fun guilt-free because i worked ahead. trust me, your homework is way easier when you do it in 5 pieces instead of all at once. if youre having trouble, try out the pomodoro method. i swear it makes any big project into a simple task.  8 turn in your homework (even if its incomplete)  i had the realization when calculating grades at the end of a terrible semester that even if i had gotten a d or f on my homeworks instead of just not turning them in at all, i would have bumped me up a letter grade. seriously, it is way better to turn in a homework with a sad attempt at a couple of problems and get a 40/100 instead of a 0/100. ideally, you should try and get a high grade on homeworks, but this is a good hack for those deep depression, procrastination days.  9 take care of your will power  in the end all this hustle is going to take a lot of will power, which studies have shown is a finite resource but can be grown like a muscle. when i go to the gym, eat healthy, sleep well, surround myself with good people, etc. i have much more will power. when i stay up late, get drunk, skip gym, fight with my significant other, etc. i lose will power. you have to take care of your physical and emotional well-being first if you expect yourself to be able to hustle. the good news is a very small decision in the right direction starts a snowball of positivity that will put you in a good place of plentiful will power. unfortunately, its also a slippery slope in the other direction. so stay vigilant.  10 hustle some more  when the holidays came around late in the semester it was so hard to maintain that hustle. admittedly, i missed a couple of classes and an assignment or two. we are all human, and we are going to mess up. old habits die hard. what is important is that you get yourself motivated again and get back on the horse. you gain nothing by beating yourself up over what you failed in the past. you only win when you learn what your mistake was and do something different. you have to act differently or you will keep getting the same results. and when you do act, do it with purpose and focus: hustle.  let me know if you have any specific questions and id be more than happy to help. for those wondering i'm an me undergrad co-op program, and when i graduate next semester it will have taken me 8 years to get my degree.  ive been there guys, for far too long, and i want to see you succeed too. if a someone like me can do it, you can definitely kill it next semester."   update: i finally graduated in may of 2015. i now have the job i wanted, in the industry i wanted to work in, doing the work i wanted to do. i am grateful every day for it. this stuff really works guys. if you're not happy with how last semester went, now is the time to turn it all around. you can do this!

406kne	01/09/2016 15:06	eseligsohn	PSA: If you're considering asking "can I handle XX credit hours?"	this question is posted over and over again.  no one else can answer it for you.  reflect on how you've done in the past with varying courseloads plus outside time commitments (jobs, clubs, etc.).  ask your friends about the specific courses you're taking this semester or look up syllabi online because specific courses affect your workload in a way not always reflected by sheer number of hours.  then, you have to make the decision.  some people can handle 21 hours and a job, while others struggle with 12 hours.  no one on this subreddit knows which of those you are.

3zw9ov	01/07/2016 16:45	swordfire	Georgia Tech Social Democratic Party	ive heard a lot of griping and discontent here at tech, especially regarding the housing, parking, and dining departments. apparently it seems that there is just a lot of complaints which are going unheard, and the administration thus doesn't do anything about it. this leads to yet more discontent and frustration.  the problem is that there is no real organized body outside of sga that represents the student body and voices its concerns. sga itself has proven to be somewhat ineffective in this regard, necessitating the need for a new body. the problem is that sga itself is not concerned enough about the problems of everyday georgia tech students and the frustration they are feeling. what we need is new leadership in that body, people who are bold enough to challenge the administration and demand change. only then can the problems plaguing our student body can be mitigated.  my plan is quite simple; i wish to create my own political party(hence the title) on campus and run a slate of candidates in the sga election being held this semester. i'll be graduating soon so i will not run; but i want to get other people together who are interested in doing so. i want to create a coordinated, unique message that the candidates can run on, enhancing their chances of winning. by taking over sga with a resounding mandate from the student body, the representatives can then take a stand and get the administration to act on the issues that affect us, making life better for techies everywhere.

(CS 2110 & CS 2340 before CS 1332)	i'm planning out a semester to study abroad next year, and i'm running into a bit of trouble with scheduling courses. given the classes offered at the partner school, it looks like i might have to take cs 2110 and/or cs 2340 before cs 1332. both of these classes only have cs 1331 as a prereq, which will be satisfied, but i was still worried of changing the order, as the default [study plan](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/infointernetworkspeople.pdf) plots cs 1332 before both of those courses. will i be fine changing the order, or should i try to take cs 1332 before those to courses? thank you, and happy holidays!

3n1azh	09/30/2015 23:55	RunyonCronin	Advice for someone who screwed themselves?	hello, i'm a second year at tech who has messed up. instead of writing a novel, i'll list this in bullet point format.    -i did really poorly freshman year, leading to academic probation and a terribad gpa under a 2.0   -despite doing much better this year (at least as far as test grades go) my gpa will remain tanked as i probably can't manage more than one a a semester and some classes (basically most math courses) scare the shit out of me because i don't think i can handle them. i say this because i know that i'm at the bottom of the bell curve here.   -i have a disciplinary mark on my transcript from last year, its nothing serious but it exists and i take responsibility for my fuck up.    -so i can't transfer, even though i really don't like this place (i could go on all day about this but it mostly involves characteristics such as the culture, location, ect)   -i can't afford this place, even with instate tuition. in short my parents didn't plan to pay for my college, i didn't get enough work during the summer, and fafsa decided i was fine. so i'm using un-cosigned loans with terrible interest rates.   -i have huge doubts about getting a job even if i make it out of here, and grad school is out of the question.   -i have almost no reprieve here. i spend twelve-ish hours a day working on classes, eight having nightmares, and four cooking, cleaning, running, and mulling over how i could potentially destroy my life. at least i haven't broken any laws or procreated, that would be a life sentence of misery.   anyway, that's it. if anyone else has advice it would be greatly appreciated. i'll stop bitching now.
3n1ahm	09/30/2015 23:51	ramblinn	4th year changing major to CS? Any advice?	hey all, i'm new to this website so please understand if i'm not using it right. also, i'm going to sound like one of those whiny kids who can't deal with stress and heavy workload, but i want to let you know i've already tried best past years and i'm fucking sick of complaining as well.   i'm a fourth year cheme (switched from me) student. the only reason i decided to stick to engineering major was because of pressure from my parents - and they regret it too. i never liked it, still can't understand the basics in this field. i'm still taking sophomore/junior classes, because  i had to retake/withdraw a lot, i mean a lot of, classes due to lack of interest and knowledge. i'm not super smart like you guys (i'm guessing my brain decided to stop functioning ever since i've come here) so i pretty much have to spend allllll day just to finish my homework. i know nothing is easy here, but it's even harder when you have force yourself to do something you don't give a fuck about. it seems like although you some of you guys hate the workload, you all like your majors and what you study. i've always wanted to change my major, but not only that i wasn't sure what i'm interested in, but also i was too afraid and hesitant to "run away". i can say for sure that if i stick with this major, it will not only kill my gpa (actually, it's already dead) but kill me because i don't want to work in this field anyway.   recently i've figured out computer science major might suit my personality and interest, but the only program i've used is matlab from my freshman year class, and i don't know much details about this field (planning to see cs adviser soon).  do you think it's worth it to change major during fourth year? (i'm worried because i've never seen anyone doing it. if i switch to cs, it'll take 4-5 semesters.) what are some ways to get familiar with studies in cs before i make my decision? some major "risks" are that : i'm not a rich kid, so i'll be on debt after graduation due to loans.  i don't know if i'll like, or i'll be good at cs or not, yet. i have none to very little experience with computer science.   thanks in advance.

AMA or just show up.	i will be the guest speaker at the ece student seminar (ece8001/2001) next wednesday (september 23) at 11:05 in architecture (east) room 207. i assume that the room change is to confuse the paparazzi. all are welcome, even those not in the class and non-ece majors.  as i believe strongly in recycling, the title of the talk this year is the same as last year: "beyond engineering: marketing, sales, & management with an engineering degree". due to poor memory skills, the talk itself will likely be entirely different this year.  for background, i got out with a phd in ee many more years ago than i like to calculate, but have worked in a variety of engineering and non-engineering positions with both large companies and startups in the years since. the talk is intended to be entertaining and hopefully useful, especially for anyone who likes engineering but wants to see what other options the working world offers.  feel free to ask questions here before and after the talk. and if you mention this post at the talk, i might have a lovely parting gift for you.

Car boot scam in progress	so i came up to atlanta this weekend for the game against tulane, and everything was supposed to be happy.  i decide that the publix in midtown is a great place to park and do some preliminary tailgate activities, like eat brunch, go to macs, and pick up some tailgate necessities.   come to find out that after eating brunch at the prickly pear, walking to macs (though not actually going in) and buying a couple things at publix is enough to get your car booted.  i tried the logical route with the employee, to no avail. they are quick to point fingers, boot your car, and ask questions never. i'm warning all of you now, at least on game days, don't even think of parking or shopping near publix.  they are boot happy and won't listen to reason or receipts with time stamps.   i love atlanta, but shit like this is unbelievable. when i actually obey the law for once, i have to pay $75.

3kmisn	09/12/2015 03:13	Dunda	Free food delivered to campus	most of you probably already know about the 50% off codes for papa johns, or maybe sign-up credits for grubhub and the like. a friend just turned me onto an even better deal though to get free or really cheap restaurant food delivered to campus.  caviar is a restaurant delivery service in atlanta and some other cities. right now they have a promo where you can get $20 off your first order (including delivery fee) by using a friend's custom share url to sign up by september 15th. plus promo code atl5 knocks another $5 off the price. (you can sometimes find $10 promo codes too if you google, but i don't think any are active right now).  i won't share my custom link here since it's against subreddit rules, but you can pm me for it, or try finding someone else's.  now, they only serve certain area codes, and 30318 and 30332 aren't included, but 30313 is, so you can enter the student center address or somewhere on techwood and pick it up there.  some notable restaurants included: taco mac, bell street burritos, king of pops, meehans, sweet auburn bbq, and a bunch of others.

3im1mm	08/27/2015 15:59	iloveavocados22	Business student considering a CS minor	hey everyone, so i have a dilemma of sorts. i started georgia tech as a computer science major (i was a transfer). however, during my first semester i had some personal issues that distracted me from school, i didn't want to (or couldn't) handle the work load and so i made the decision to switch my major to business and concentrate in information technology.  i am now a senior and i am eligible to graduate in the spring of 2016. however, i am not entirely satisfied with how easy my it concentration classes are and i regret switching majors from cs to business.  so i've been considering getting a cs minor. since i have already taken cs 1331, i would only need to take 5 more classes to complete my minor (my thread would be people). however, doing so will set me back a few semesters from graduating and instead of graduating in the spring, i will have to graduate in fall 2016. it would also be challenging to get in all the cs classes i need within three semesters, however i think it is doable.  so my question is, do you guys think the cs minor is worth the extra school and debt? do employers care about the minor? how many more opportunities will the minor really open?   edit: thanks for your opinions and advice!

I hope you're happy.	bud pretty much said that state allocations have gone down so tuition will go up. an interesting fact he cited was that only about 10% of our budget comes from tuition, and a similarly small fraction comes from the endowment.

3ickqf	08/25/2015 16:16	mrjitters2012	Message from Dean Stein on Sexual Violence and Misconduct	dear students:  as the fall semester begins and students participate in a variety of social activities, i would like to take this opportunity to remind you about georgia techs policies regarding alcohol and drugs and sexual misconduct. our goal is to maintain an environment that is consistent with the educational focus of georgia tech and to promote the safety and wellbeing of our students.   as part of its mission to provide a safe learning environment for students, georgia tech is committed to preventing sexual violence and addressing sexual misconduct. georgia tech recently refined its existing sexual misconduct policy to more effectively do the following:   support survivors by facilitating how they can report sexual misconduct and receive the support services needed, communicate the responsibilities of all parties involved in an instance of sexual violence or sexual misconduct, and provide transparency to the reporting and appeal process.   the revised sexual misconduct policy http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/student-sexual-misconduct-policy-change outlines the scope of what behaviors are included.  for example, the policy now considers intimate partner/dating violence, stalking, advocating for, inciting, or actively encouraging sexual violence, coercion, and intimidation as potential violations. in addition, the revised policy outlines first-considered sanctions for violating the policy. this includes expulsion as a sanction of first consideration for non-consensual sexual intercourse. for more information on georgia techs sexual violence prevention initiative and how to get in touch with our victim-survivor advocates, visit the voice website http://www.voice.gatech.edu/.   further, i am including links to the alcohol and drug policy, the campus alcohol policy, and the student/student organization alcohol policy. all policies serve to educate the community on the responsible use of alcohol by students of legal drinking age and the consequences of using illegal drugs on-campus. also included below is a link to the good samaritan provision. a provision intended to support the individual efforts of students acting responsibly along with providing a health focused response to the incident rather than a disciplinary consequence.     alcohol and drug policy: http://www.osi.gatech.edu/plugins/content/index.php?id=42  campus alcohol policy: http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/campus-use-facilities/campus-alcohol-policy  student/student organization alcohol policy: http://policylibrary.gatech.edu/studentstudent-organization-alcohol-policy  good samaritan provision: http://www.osi.gatech.edu/uploads/files/goodsamaritan.pdf   i ask that you take a few minutes to read and understand these policies. if you have any questions, please contact my office at 404-894-6367or http://deanofstudents.gatech.edu.   thank you,  john m. stein  vice president for student life and dean of students

Should I still go into CS 1332?	hey all, i took and passed the exam on tuesday. however, the passing score was a 70 and i got a 65. they told me the professor for the class thought grading was too harsh and she took a second look at borderline grades. she decided my exam was good enough to let pass.   now i'm trying to decide whether i actually want to go into cs 1332 immediately. i could either stay in cs 1331 and get an easy a, but i'll learn nothing new until 2/3 into the semester. i can start cs 1332 and learn new stuff right away and get ahead in my major, but it'll certainly be more rigorous.   any help with making my decision by end of registration tomorrow?  java is my first and primary language for 4 years and i've even made a few android apps. i've learned everything covered in cs 1331 at one point (except javafx, i learned swing), but it's been a while since i've used them.   what should i do?

(for reference, i am an eas major) i am an incoming freshman for the fall semester, but i already have all of my math credits up to differential equations. obviously i was put on a waitlist for the class when i applied, so my advisor said to take both my intro to eas lab course and replace diff eqs with the first chem course i need to take. from what i've heard, taking two lab courses in a semester is hard enough, never mind me being a freshman and doing marching band as well. should i just drop the chem class and pick up something like spanish? (been wanting to get completely fluent) my ap scores have taken care of any future social science requirements, so i feel like i wouldn't be all that set back. thanks

As a new MSCS student, when do I register?	okay everyone. the gmail forwarding answers seem annoying to setup. the easiest answer to me seems to be using your device's native client. this, too, is more confusing than it needs to be.    &nbsp;   this is how it's done for your reference: (before you do any of the following, make sure your email account is setup with office365)    &nbsp;   **ios:**  1. go to **settings -> mail, contacts, calendars**  2. select **add account**  3. select exchange  4. enter your gatech **email** and **password**, then press next  5. make sure the **email** field contains your email address  6. leave the **server** field blank.  7. enter **outlook.office365.com** for the **domain** field.  8. enter **yourusername@gatech.edu** for the **username** field. note that this might not be the same as your email address  9. enter your *password**  10. press next and your email account should work   &nbsp;   **mac osx:**  1. open the native mail client  2. select **mail -> add account**  3. select exchange  4. press **continue**. ignore the message. press **continue** again.  5. enter **yourusername@gatech.edu** for the **username**. note that this might not be the same as your email address.   6. enter your **password**  7. for **server address** enter enter **outlook.office365.com**  8. press **continue**  9. it should work   &nbsp;   **windows (using windows 8 appstore mail client):**  1. if it isn't already installed, install microsoft's mail client from the windows app store.   2. open the mail app (might have to search for it, then pin it to your start menu)  3. if you're not prompted to add an email account, swipe up from the bottom-right corner and select **add an account** on the window that appears  4. select **exchange**  5. click **show more details**  6. for **email address** enter your gatech email address  7. for **server address** enter **outlook.office365.com**  8. leave **domain** blank  9. for **username** enter **yourusername@gatech.edu**. note that this might not be the same as your email address.  10. for **password** enter your password  11. press **connect**  12. your email account should work   &nbsp;   **windows (with outlook):** follow steps similar to the above. [prodoxgt's answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/3f7bq0/new_student_questions_whats_the_best_way_to_check/ctm94jz) below should help.   &nbsp;   **other platforms and clients:** extrapolate the steps yourself based on the above

3f3v21	07/30/2015 01:44	mynameisnotjose	Watch out for scammers	so this is kind of an embarrassing story but recently i was scammed for more money than i'd like to admit. i was around tech square waiting for the trolley when a man came up to me asking about the trolley. he asked me for change for a 50 and i said i didn't have it, he kept asking me how much i got and i told him and said tell me what you got and i'll just give you a $50 back. at this point i should have realized something was fishy but i didn't so i gave him what i had. i was reluctant to so he said "i'm trying to sell this guy some marijuana and i just need some change i'll give you a fifty". now is when i really should have just walked away, but anyways i give him money and then he says "ok i'll go get the fifty". he then walks across the street, goes into his car and drives off. pretty mad at myself for falling for something that stupid, but yeah don't make the same mistake i did of giving strangers change if something's not right.

3emkff	07/26/2015 03:34	gt762	Attendance in Ga Tech classes: why is it so bad?	lately i have been wondering about attendance at this school.  i feel like it is extremely common for me to go into a decent-sized classroom meant to hold the 50+ people registered and see maybe half of it filled.  sometimes much less.  for a lot of classes i have taken, at every lecture it has been visually obvious that few people bothered to show up, even when the lecturer is very good.  to people that have gone to other schools and transferred to tech, how does our attendance compare to attendance at your other school?  to the professors that read this subreddit, do you feel there is an attendance problem at this school or that you struggle to get people to come to class?  i'm curious to hear anybody's opinion on it, although i am mostly asking because i'm not sure if it really is below average attendance given that tech is the only university i have ever attended.  my friends that go to small schools in my home state say their attendance isn't nearly as bad.  for all i know though tech's attendance is great for its size.  i am cs and applied math and have taken 87 hours at tech to give an idea of where i am coming from with my experiences (maybe other major's classes are better attended).

The reasons you chose your major?	i'm transferring into tech this fall for me, but over the course of the two years the real goal was to just get myself out of my other college (southern) and set myself up in a place i can have awesome and great oppurtunities career-wise. the dilemma that developed over the past two years was what major would i be when i got to tech. i have been doing me for the past two years, and i still can't tell if i want to stay in it. i love the business aspect of working; the traveling, the lifestyle, and the amount of effort put into the buzz of the corporate world, but i also love the stimulation from discovery.   so all in all, it's down to me or isye when i pick my major. i hear isye is really out of place in the physical world of pragmatic engineering, but it's still a mathematical based career path.    my question is: why did you pick your major? is it really something you're ready to dedicate your life to? is it something i should dedicate my life to?  tl;dr: transferring in fall. me vs isye. why did you choose your major?

Opinions needed!	hello all!  i'm writing as an out-of-towner who will be moving to atlanta august 1st to start school. i'm hoping to get some advice from the kind folks here in r/gatech, as i'm pretty unfamiliar with the neighborhoods and rental prices in the city. thank you in advance for any input, it's very much appreciated.  long story short: i have to make a decision very quickly between two housing options. here's my dilemma:  **option 1:** room in midtown, walking distance to school, two *great* housemates that i have gotten to know fairly well. at the upper limit of my budget, but manageable without too much pain. the room itself is very small and gets limited light, but has its own bathroom and is updated, and the rest of the house is incredible and spacious.  **option 2:** room in loring heights, not walking distance, but 20ish minute bus or bike ride. larger room with more light, plus my own bathroom, but in a much older house in more...lived in condition. $100-$150 less per month, but only one other housemate. i've had limited exchange thus far with the other occupant, but i don't see any reason that it wouldn't be a fine match.  so, gateche-ers--what would you suggest, as citizens of the fine city of atlanta? **quality and location at a higher cost, or space and savings at the cost of convenience and standards?** to be clear, i can afford both responsibly (the more expensive room is .38% of my monthly budget, the less expensive is .33%), but i don't have the luxury of knowing neighborhoods and other factors, such as walkability.  again, i'm in your debt and thank you in advance for your sage wisdom!

(1 this semester) the problem is, all foreign languages classes need pre-requisites so i can't take a foreign language class with humanities credit. therefore, i can either take phil or lmc class only. but many lmc classes are restricted to that major only and i ended up registering for phil 3109 by kirkman which is an ethics credit class, when i don't need ethics really. is a class with both humanities credit and ethics credit way harder than a humanities class without ethics credit? i would want to avoid unnecessary time consuming classes..

3dj5d7	07/16/2015 18:15	Filoleg94	Proposal Writing+Thesis Writing classes?	hi everyone. if you don't care for the explanation, there is a very concise and straight to the point tl;dr at the bottom.  as a cs major i have 4 options of fulfilling my capstone requirement: jr design, sr design, vip project, and capstone research. working in a lab i enjoy working at and with my research mentor who encourages me to do the capstone research, i am heavily leaning towards it. however, they just implemented a change to the research capstone that makes me question the situation. i just came back from my cs adviser who laid out all options and explained everything for me, so now i want to hear some student input on that.   basically, it used to be that every option for capstone took only 6 credit hours split among the work itself+writing class or something. the introduced change makes the research capstone to be 11-12 hours (that will very likely overflow the number of my free electives), because now to do it, you have to do the whole research option thing (http://undergradresearch.gatech.edu/research-option), which is composed of actual research hours + the proposal/thesis writing classes in question. i want to know how bad they are from someone who did it. if you did them as a cs major, even better.   **tl;dr**: if you took proposal writing and/or thesis writing classes at tech (or did the research option thing, the one that shows up on your diploma), i want to hear your opinion on those classes, since the capstone option i am leaning towards the most requires both of those.

3d8n7k	07/14/2015 10:45	StolenNachoRanger	Should I retake a class in which I got a good grade, but learned absolutely nothing? (Info in description)	i'm a rising 2nd year currently taking mse 2001 in china as part of the china summer program.  the class has gone... disastrously, to say the best.    the first half of the program had one professor, and the latter has a different professor.  the first professor didn't particularly follow the syllabus, never gave us any grades of any form, and then promised to give a take home test before leaving.    we never received a test.  the second professor was considerably more organized, and gave a test over only material he covered (average grade was well below failing) and we have an upcoming final this weekend.  out of nowhere we're suddenly being given the test from the first half of the course as well, as an open-internet, open-note, open-everything test.  it covers some stuff we never covered in class and is basically just a test of if you can use google.  moral of the story is that i'm going to receive a fine grade in the class, but i've learned pretty much nothing.  it seems as if the professors know it's a failure and they're pretty much trying to shut everybody up by just handing out good grades at the end.  i'm an ae and i've heard that this class is fairly important for later classes.  i'm worried that if i take the credit and run, it'll catch up with me later.  any suggestions?

3ciwuf	07/08/2015 07:04	tttadvice	Incoming Freshman at GT...transfer offer from U-Mich	-having second thoughts about gt -cs major -out of state for both schools -u-mich offers to accept as a sophomore transfer w/o application -must maintain 3.0 gpa for the transfer to happen (is it likely to keep a 3.0 freshman year at gt???) i'm really stuck on what to do. i really like gt for its future job opportunities, but after spending some time on reddit and the internet in general gt seems to be a really hard difficult school and i'm starting to have second thoughts. u-mich is more well known in where i'm from (so job opportunities == gt's).i don't think i'm a smart person. i really sincerely believe that the reason i did well on the act and have a good gpa was simply because i'm a hard worker. i'm freaking out about college and beyond because i feel like the day when hard work is not enough would come. so maybe i'm posting to look for words of encouragement. it's like i'm offered a ticket out of gt and i've to decide soon because it would seem more practical (financially) for me to go to a community college and then transfer u-mich.

3by7bn	07/03/2015 03:24	lushkiller	Got a parking ticket for the expired meter for the space in front of mine. Is it worth trying to challenge it?	haven't had the greatest luck with gt parking lately.     i got to school and parked on mcmillan st at around 11:45 this morning. the space in front of me was the first space before the bus stop and had a car parked in it and the meter was expired. i parked in the second space and put all the quarters i had, 4 1/2 hours worth, into the second meter, but then it read only 3 1/2 hours. great. this meant i had to leave my 4 hour lab an hour early to avoid a ticket. i return to my car when there was 15 minutes left (around 3pm) on the meter and a ticket was already waiting for me.    the ticket was time stamped at 12:57pm and was for an expired meter, but it was for the first meter, which i believe is the meter that corresponds to the first space which i was not parked in but behind.  i took pictures showing that my meter still had time on it, but i imagine that they won't take it as evidence. having heard the horror stories of trying to deal with the parking office, am i better off just paying the $25 fine rather than try to get the ticket dismissed?   **tl;dr: got parking ticket for an expired meter that was the meter for the space in front of me while my meter still had time on it. is it worth fighting the $25 fine?**

3bgxsa	06/29/2015 03:13	throwaway13241234123	Advice on switching into CS going into my 2nd year	i've taken 1301 and 2316, and upon my own personal research about the major in addition to these classes i've for sure decided that i want to switch to cs (my mind is made up, that's not what i'm uncertain about). however, the problem i'm having is deciding whether or not i should try and test out of 1331 and take 1332 in the fall along with 2110 plus combinatorics and some other class i can find, or if i should do 1331, take 4400 and then as of now it looks like i'd do a math class like combinatorics and probably wellness and just whatever other filler credits i could find. my problem lies in having no more social sciences/humanities/ethics/global perspectives requirements to fulfill so i'm kind of struggling to find enough classes to take due to being bottle necked by 1331, if that makes sense. i'm currently teaching myself java and following along with the 1331 website but it is proving to be more work than i thought it would be. i guess my main concern right now is i'm wondering how far will i be behind if i start 1331 in the fall of my 2nd year, while struggling to find classes to take in addition to it that will actually contribute towards my diploma? is it feasible to graduate in 4 years still while starting 1331 so late?

Advice Please	i'm in my fourth semester of ee now (co-op last spring 2015).   the more i learn programming (not just language wise, but algorithm concepts) by myself on sites like edx and coursera, i lose interest in ee.   i have thought of changing my  major to cs sometimes, but the feeling of wasting my ece credits keep me from that.   i just finished my first co-op term (mostly plc/hmi programming, and database management in sql the whole time). it pays really well. i'm almost certain that my boss wouldn't care if i change my major since he only cares about my potential and aptitudes. they only hire ee for co-op as first though.  minoring in cs is an option, but i really want to avoid taking those ee courses that i have zero interest in like emag, signal and system, electrical energy.  i know for a fact that the knowledge from these course will be useless for me after going out of school and getting into the real world for one semester.   another reason that turn me off on ee is ece2036. i learn nothing from this class. i thought i would learn a lot of programming in this class but i"m so disappointed at the moment by the teaching quality and the structure of the class. clearly my professor cannot teach programming to anybody. i don't understand why he can be a professor when he cannot teach an introduction class like this.   please give me your advice. change it or not? look like i should change it. lol. i guess i'm looking for some encouragement or some buddies that have similar situation. :d

37dlte	05/26/2015 21:19	NotJoshLyman	A bunch of people messaged me about my XPS 13. Here is a more thorough review with some thermal pictures.	overall it's a pretty solid piece of equipment. dell has made a concerted effort to ensure that it supports ubuntu. you can actually get it from dell with ubuntu and not windows. if you do get it with windows you can dual boot it. they lay out how to do it in their forums and continually release patches and updates to keep it running smoothly. it has pretty solid battery life. in power saver mode getting 7 hours out of it is pretty easy. that's with continuous web browsing. if you're doing processor intensive stuff(gaming, 4k video) it's going to last closer to 5 hours. casing on the inside around the keyboard is some sort of carbon fiber/ kevlar composite. it feels soft which is a bit weird. screen looks great. it can technically handle a 3200 x 1800 image but playing video above 1080p and it'll start dropping frames. 2k video still looks good but at 4k it becomes very noticeable. camera location is weird(placed bottom left side). you have to sit slightly off center when using it. they do this to keep the edges of the display extremely narrow. since it doesn't have that huge border between the screen and the side of the case like lenovo or acer the whole thing has almost exactly the same footprint as a macbook air. it's touch screen too but i almost never use it.   http://i.imgur.com/ncvpajg.jpg  this is a second laptop for me. i have a workhorse that drives 3  21' displays with the xps being dedicated to school. overall i'm happy with it. it's light, great battery life, sharp display, big keys that makes it easy to type (even with my lana kane size hands). some people have complained about it getting hot but i really haven't experienced it. here are a couple thermal pictures after playing 4k video for 5 minutes.   http://i.imgur.com/boartjv.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/421t1yp.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/rfomwwt.jpg  it says 92.3 at the vent but it doesn't feel even close to that.  edit: residual heat from my ass on my desk http://i.imgur.com/jsvolvp.jpg . because i can.

(they said on the faq page that they don't care, but i highly doubt that) in another word, does someone attending uiuc have a better chance than uga just because uiuc has a better overall reputation?(under the condition that they are both in engineering program)?   4. are there anyone in gt who transferred from uga(any engineering major)? are there anyone who studied cs at uga and transferred to gt?  5. if you transferred from uga, what was ur gpa?    i have already emailed gt admission office, still waiting for a response, but i still want to hear from the perspective of current students. tuition is not a huge issue but my parents will need to take out loans and i am worried that it is not worth it.  plzzzzz help this kid.......... thank you

Renovations to Van Leer coming!	here's an email i got:  dear ece alumni,  i am very pleased to announce that texas instruments has donated $3.2 million to support the construction of the texas instruments plaza and maker space for the school of electrical and computer engineering.   the plaza and maker space will be located adjacent to and in the van leer building. the most significant change will be to the van leer auditorium, which will be renovated to create a three-level maker space. it will be open to both ece students and students from any major at georgia tech. some conceptual drawings were shown during the ece town hall meeting a couple of months ago.   work on the building design will begin later this summer with an anticipated completion date of late 2016 or early 2017. a previous $2m gift from harris corporation; major gifts from allen ecker (bee 1957 & msee 1958), randy poliner (bee 1977), steve chaddick (bee 1974 & msee 1982), warren batts (bee 1961), alek szlam (bee 1974 & msee 1980), and gene sapp (bee 1959); and donated funds from numerous alumni are making the project a reality. you can read more about the project and see additional conceptual drawings in this institute press release.  van leer plaza conceptual drawing we are not waiting for the new design space to be completed before gearing up our maker-space activities. starting in the fall, we will open up one of the current senior design spaces for anyone on campus to use. modeled on the operation of the georgia tech invention studio, student university lab leaders will staff the lab to assist people with the tools and their designs. the ieee student branch has developed a set of tutorials on embedded systems and will run workshops in that design space, and a vip team is developing some sample open-ended embedded systems projects, guiding students with training modules that put a little more rigor into the hacker mentality. a new sophomore-level elective lab course, practical skills and design, is being offered to teach students how to build their own projects.  the goal is to get our students tinkering early in their gt career. when the doors finally open for the new maker space, we will be ready with trained student university lab leaders, training materials and projects on ece-specific tools and processes, and a student population with the skills and desire to make full use of it immediately.  thank you for your commitment to ece. i look forward to sharing updates on this important project with you as progress is made. to learn more about how you can get involved with the maker space, please feel free to reach out to martina hubbarth, director of development.   sincerely,  steven w. mclaughlin steve w. chaddick school chair and professor

(i have meeting with my new advisor next week, but i just wanted to have some ideas on my new major.) all i have left are cs and lmc classes to graduate.  spr '16<cs 2050 - social science - lmc - lmc - lmc>  i already have credit for 1301 from 1371 but no chance to register for 1331... 20th on waitlist, and it hasn't changed for days. so i'm thinking about making this a "joke" semester and self-teach java to prepare for next semester maybe? or would it be better i take 1301? hmm...   fall'16 <- cs 1331 - cs 4475 - lmc - lmc - lmc>again, can't take any other cs classes because 1331 is pretty much prereq for everything except 4475 (1301 required)...   spr '17 <- cs 1332 - cs 2261 - cs 2340 - lmc - lmc> i guess this will be the toughest semester, but have to take these to take cs 3451 upcoming semester...   fall' 17 < - cs 3451 - cs 4001 or lmc - cs elec - lmc - lmc>  annnnnd spr'18 <- capstone - lmc or cs4001>it doesn't matter if it's full time but i wasn't sure how much time capstone would take...     thanks in advance, and i apologize again for this! good luck this semester,  everyone.

40pu9d	01/13/2016 02:21	AntionOmega	Thinking about transferring to G-tech.	hey guys, so i'm currently a freshman at syracuse university, but i'm thinking about applying here to georgia tech. i think i might have a problem though and i was hoping you guys could help or at least give me some info.   i'm currently in the liberal arts college at syracuse university, but i would want to transfer into your comp sci program. looking at the transfer requirements i ran into a few things that somewhat stumped me since they don't necessarily seem possible for me to do.   so first a little background on me at syracuse i guess:  -currently have a 3.905 gpa after this first semester and was accepted into the honors program.   -in the fall i took an intro psych course, an intro philosophy course, an intro stats course, a writing course, an intro to communication sciences and disorders course (no lab component), and i'm just finishing a logic course which i took over the break.   -in the spring (my spring courses seem very different since i basically did a 180 on what i wanted to study) i'm going to be taking calc 1, an intro public policy course (i want to end up working in technology policy), two honors courses that are quite specific but essentially the first is an honors humanities and the second is an honors social science, and finally an upper division philosophy course about ai.   so to me it definitely doesn't look like i could complete all of the "required courses" to apply even if i changed my whole schedule around since su doesn't let students take the equivalent of your second writing course until sophomore fall.   my main question is- does this mean it wouldn't be physically possible for me to transfer until junior fall? and what would that even mean since i doubt i could complete that many requirements in time to actually be counted as a junior. on top of that, you guys don't even seem to accept credit for any of my school's comp sci courses or my first writing course. does this mean it's literally impossible for me to ever transfer?  apologies for the super long post, but i'm kinda worried here since this is something i would really love. thank you so much in advance for the help!!!

rights and constitutionality in hearings, took inspiration from the national organization of fire (foundation for individual rights in education) and set out to raise awareness and push for reforms. today, we continue that mission in bringing you this update, the first of several this week, concerning the state of our campus and all the exciting developments that many of you have been seeing hints of for weeks. by releasing the full text of the lawsuits to you, the student body, we hope that you will look through the relevant case files, as provided in the lawsuits, and finally be able to decide for yourself whether there is an inherent bias to these cases.   **john doe case 1**  first of all, i will start with the original john doe lawsuit. the lawsuit in question, [available in its full text here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0b9vdbaejwv5yx1rbehvynzayq1e&usp=sharing), sought a preliminary injunction to allow the defendant to return to school and complete his aerospace degree. for a variety of reasons, the court found that the case did not meet the requirement of substantial likelihood of success of its merits, a requirement to preliminary injunction, and so denied the injunction itself. however, the judge notes in the final paragraphs of this [denial of the injunction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5ymklrdc1zd1zfvms/view?usp=sharing)  > the court has a number of concerns regarding the investigation. to put it bluntly, mr. paquettes testimony at the preliminary injunction hearing about the course of the investigation and the manner in which he made certain investigatory decisions was very far from an ideal representation of due process. much remains 37 case 1:15-cv-04079-scj document 31 filed 12/16/15 page 38 of 38 for the courts consideration as to whether mr. paquettes investigation veered so far from the ideal as to be unconstitutional.  as such, it is quite probable that despite the loss of the injunction, that this is not the last weve heard of this first case. examining the legal documents themselves yields a full (and completely anonymized) case file internal to osi. this casefile can be found on page 49 of the [injunction itself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5yemnpseotnzhfq00/view?usp=sharing). examination of this casefile and and the accompanying [complaint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5yvxztzfvnbvfenmc/view?usp=sharing) reveals the following failures on osis part:  * mr. paquette refused to interview 6 additional witnesses prior to charging mr. doe, and ultimately only interviewed 1 of those witnesses prior to reaching his decision.^[complaint ^ ^62, ^67, ^68, ^75]  * mr. paquette refused to interview informant 11, the only other person to see mr. doe and ms. roe in the room in question. mr. paquette included a text message from informant 11, but did not question them in person nor attempt to contact them over the phone.^[complaint ^ ^68, ^69, ^78-79]   * when a previous source of information for the victim, informant 1, wanted to be re- interviewed, mr. paquette declined to interview her. this informant was the president of jane roes sorority and had new information she wished to bring forward.^[complaint ^ ^81]  * despite contradictions in the stories of both john doe and jane roe, mr. paquette completely discounted the contradictions in ms. roes statements and chose to focus exclusively on those in mr. roes, despite the relatively low importance of the details in particular.^[complaint ^ ^91]  * prior to bringing the charges against mr. doe, mr. paquette had interviewed 7 witnesses, all women, and 6 of whom identified themselves as friends of ms. roe. only one of these women were present at the october 10th date night.^[complaint ^ ^65]  * the initial charges seem to rely heavily on rumor and the reputation of mr. doe, rather than actual facts.^[complaint ^ ^72]  * mr. paquette withheld knowledge of who the witnesses were from mr. roe until 30 minutes prior to his final interview, giving him little chance to prepare any defense.^[complaint ^ ^89, ^90]  * mr. paquette apparently laughed in the face of mr. does attorney, grossly unprofessional conduct^[complaint ^ ^98]  * despite being convinced that the texts mentioned in the report were not sexual in nature, mr. paquette kept the phrase respondent continued to send her text messages of a sexual nature at the top of the report, despite knowing that it was patently false. this likely hurt mr. roes chances during the appeal process.^[complaint ^ ^100-106]  finally, it is of import to note that mr. paquette does not keep actual transcripts of any interviews he has with the witnesses, paraphrasing their testimony into easily transcribed paragraphs. while this is most likely not malicious in nature, it is negligent and full recordings of the witness interviews ought to be kept in the future.  **john doe case 2**  next, we have the case of john doe v john roe. this case is of unique interest because it features two men, a condition that leads to a large number of gender-based assumptions in relationships falling away, leading to a case devoid of classical assumptions about consent. this case is also notable as it gives a glimpse into the incredibly convoluted nature of appeals at georgia tech, as well as being the only case to date that has resulted in the readmission of a student at georgia tech.  as many people are unfamiliar with this case in question, i will attempt to paraphrase what i have gleaned from the [legal documents](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0b9vdbaejwv5yckw4qtvub0jxqm8&usp=sharing) related to it. of special note are the [injunction](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5yrjbkmumxadvkm3m/view?usp=sharing), the [casefile](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5yrutcs1izctlqqmc/view?usp=sharing), and the [complaint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5yegxxtkxiq1itb3c/view?usp=sharing). mr. doe, the defendant and a closeted bisexual (to his parents), hooked up with mr. roe in april of 2015. following this, mr. roe pursued mr. doe far more than the other did, resulting in mr. roe coming to visit mr. doe during his summer travels and going on a retreat with him that fall. however, when it became clear that mr. doe was not interested in pursuing a relationship with mr. roe, mr. roe asked mr. doe to delete their facebook conversations. mr. doe complied and mr. roe then went to mr. paquette with a series of (supposedly doctored) facebook messages and a story about how mr. doe had sexually assaulted him. during mr. paquettes investigation, he ignored testimony from various witnesses that a conversation mr. roe claimed had taken place, had in fact, not taken place and went on to expel mr. roe for sexual assault, only giving him an hour to review the report and make comments before convicting him. mr. doe was clearly quite isolated during the investigation, most likely because he did not want his family to learn of his sexual orientation.   mr. doe immediately appealed the conviction and with the help of additional evidence that had not been pursued in the original investigation, was able to prove his innocence to the appellate committee. the conviction was overturned and all seemed well until the parents of mr. roe filed an appeal one day past the deadline. as the appeal must be filed on time and by the defendant mr. roe himself, not his parents, this should have been the end of it. however, president peterson decided to accept the appeal and upheld mr. paquettes original decision. following this, mr. doe appealed to the board of regents, who remanded the decision back to president peterson, who remanded it back to the appellate committee, who upheld the original decision, this time directed by president peterson to do so. finally, the appeal ended up back at the board of regents, who held an emergency meeting shortly after the lawsuit was filed and finally readmitted mr. roe.   some qualms to be had with this case are as follows  * the process for appeal is hopelessly convoluted.  * georgia tech blatantly and knowingly disregarded its own policies on the filing of appeals. tech consulted their lawyers, who told them that it would probably be okay before giving the go-ahead to allow the late appeal to be filed. [source](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b9vdbaejwv5ywve2qy1qru5hmfe/view?usp=sharing)  * if mr. doe had brought an osi investigation against mr. roe prior to mr. roe bringing one, would the onus be on mr. roe to get mr. does consent? is the notion of consent in this case based purely on who filed a complaint to osi first?  * mr. paquette blatantly disregarded discrepancies in the accounts of the witnesses as to how intoxicated the various parties were and also continued to believe mr. roes assertion of a rather predatory discussion occurring at the band table despite assertions from multiple witnesses, who were claimed to be involved in said discussion, that they did not recall ever having such a discussion.   **the task force report**  finally, we get to the task force report. back in october, bud peterson formed a task force to investigate osi conduct, following the success of a petition formed in the wake of the phi delta theta letter. around mid-december, the task force wrapped up their investigation and released their report. not a lot of people realize that its been released, as they did so over the break. while we have the text of it in full, weve been advised that we need to wait until later this week before posting it. so instead of posting it, ill run down a quick summary of what they found:  * the investigation found, correctly, that most of the time (95%+), the process works just fine. these are the open and shut cases, destruction of property, cheating, trespassing in tech tower, the like. however, for 5% or so of cases, change is overwhelmingly necessary.   * the investigation before charges are filed is often biased and not even-handed, seeking to find enough evidence to file charges. when this investigation itself is used as evidence, even more problems crop up.  * creating more charges on top of original charges presents a problem that causes those in charge to often have a skewed view of guilt, based on the additional charges.   * only cases involving expulsion or suspension can be appealed; this should be changed.   * there is no method to challenge the bias of the investigator and adjudicator. there needs to be a method.  * reasons behind the findings are not required by the administrative trial; this should change, as the judge in these cases should always have to explain their reasoning.   * **title ix issues are not specifically addressed, as the board of regents will be revisiting that issue specifically this year, rewriting the guidelines on a statewide level.**  moving forward this semester, were going to become an officially chartered club and will continue our push to ensure that all georgia tech students have access to fair and impartial justice. if this is something that you think you might be interested in, wed love to have your help in making a difference at georgia tech. feel free to [join our facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/537170449790173/), where were going to be keeping everyone up to date.  citations  * john doe 1 - 1:15-cv-04079  * john doe 2 - 1:15-cv-04354

Need advice.	throwaway account for privacy reasons, but long story short, i f***ed up this semester at my home institution.  i took too many classes this semester, while still working nearly full time at a stressful job.   diffeq is one of those classes that i couldn't just breeze by, and requires a time investment outside of class. nor did the subject material come naturally to me. however with my financial and family situation, it was nearly impossible for me to reserve the time needed, and the first two tests i failed.    from there i was able to pass the next two tests (one with a mid b), but that, combined with a final this morning which was ruined by a migrane, was not enough to bring my grade up to the required level.  taking another fall semester at my home is not possible: i will not have transportation then.    i don't know what to do anymore.  i screwed up and am now paying the ultimate price.

Just received a copyright email from Georgia Tech.	i just received 2 emails for having torrented the 2nd episode of game of thrones this season. i am not on campus and this is my first instance of having been caught. so apparently all georgia tech will do is make sure i delete my torrent client and illegally downloaded stuff before i open a browser on lawn and follow their future instructions (anyone know what these are?) on that.  what worries me is what hbo may pursue to do. both georgia tech and hbo are waiting for me to reply regarding the same and georgia tech mentioned they can't control what hbo would do. hbo has at the moment stated that they just wish me to be punished based on georgia tech's rules which is just temporarily suspending my access but have stated that they are not waiving their rights to pursue more action.  so what should i do? any ideas on what may happen or has anyone experienced this before? any advice would be helpful thanks.

34lj14	05/02/2015 05:40	Starsy	Who should be contacted about problems with graduation planning?	i graduated today, and while the majority of the event went fantastically, there were two major issues that had a strong negative effect on the day as a whole:  - the time between phd hooding and phd/masters commencement. i understand why hooding was split into a separate ceremony -- i don't like it, but i understand it. but the problem is that hooding starts at 10am, while commencement ends at 9pm. that's 11 hours from the start of the day to the end of the day. for people in from out of town or people who live too far to drive home in between, that's a long-ass day. why not have them closer together? honestly, if i could do it again, i would have skipped one or the other just because the excessive time between them made it difficult to enjoy the day.  - after commencement, graduating students were shuffled through the tunnel under mccamish to the outside. we weren't permitted to re-enter the stadium, but no one bothered to tell the people on the inside of the stadium that we weren't allowed to reenter. my phone was dead, and my mother and wife wandered around for half an hour trying to find me because no one fucking told them that they had to meet us outside. there were signs that suggested where to gather ("your graduates will meet you outside the west entrance" with no guidance as to which entrance is the 'west' entrance), but we had prearranged where to meet, so they figured we'd stick to our plan. no where was it made clear to those inside the arena that reentering the arena to find your party was forbidden (based on what i heard from multiple people -- obviously, i wasn't in there to know what they were told, but my mother, wife, adviser, and four other people i spoke to had no idea).  - that on its own was poor planning that could have been easily remedied -- just announce "graduates will not be able to reenter the stadium, so please meet them outside." however, what happened as a result was absolute absurdity. there were guards posted at every door to make sure no one came back in when someone was exiting (the doors were locked). on multiple occasions, i saw guards physically grab, push, and verbally accost graduates and their families. one woman, who i believe was in charge (different colored shirt, and the others kept coming to her with questions) pulled a door closed *while someone's arm was in it* to prevent them from coming back in.  it was absolutely absurd. these are families who came to georgia tech to celebrate their kids' and relatives' achievements. these are students celebrating one of the greatest achievements of their lives. and as a university, how do we treat them? like criminals breaking into the stadium to vandalize it or something. we send people to yell at them, physically push and pull them, and treat them like dirt.  it's absolutely absurd what these people put these friends, families, and graduates through today. i don't know who to contact, but i want someone to know what was going on.

Please do something!	before i get a down vote brigade, i don't like speeding tickets either. but i really don't like hearing about people being killed or injured either. and when everyone is in their own little world because of finals, it is more important that this sort of driving be rectified.  i wouldn't post this if it hasn't been an endemic issue over the last few weeks. hell, even just park a vehicle there.  edit: the stretch from regents to 10th street... i blame finals on my brain atm...

34bv9u	04/29/2015 22:21	PanickedPenguin	Let's Talk About A Certain CS 1332 Rule	i'm not sure if this has been mentioned before but why does this class have the rule "your exam average must be passing in addition to having a passing overall average to pass this class?" no other class i have taken at tech has this rule and it has made things very tough for me.  i admit, i did very very badly on one exam this sem and it is completely my fault and i deserved the grade i got. but i'm not the greatest cs test taker ever and i feel like i am being punished for doing badly on one exam. my other two exam grades are decent and i have good homework and recitation grades which end up not mattering as much in the long run. because of that second exam i had to get a 96 on the final in order to have a passing exam average when, if that rule did not exist, i could have gotten an 80 in order to pass the class. i know for a fact i did not hit that 96 goal and i probably have to retake this class again when that 80 goal is much more feasible. i'm sorry if it sounds like i'm rambling but it just does not feel like the correct way to handle grading in this class. i just feel extremely exhausted after really trying hard to get a good grade and the climb was so difficult because of this. i just wanted to know your guys' thoughts on this.

33yl17	04/26/2015 21:33	Captain_Awesom	Archery Club Practice on Campus	the yellow jacket archery club currently borrows a practice field from gsu. it's hurts our membership because we have to meet at 8am on saturdays to get everyone together and drive to the field. and who wakes up that early on saturday?! we usually have cancellations last minute because people don't want to go wake up that early.  my big question is that we are going to start pushing to be able to practice in burger bowl, which means we would have to close down the center sidewalk for obvious safety reasons. granted we don't exactly have the right to do so, but i don't see another option. if there were signs stating to not use that sidewalk, would you still do it? most people i've asked have said they would walk through anyway. so what are some good ways to stop people from using that sidewalk?  edit 1: i'm mostly here to get feedback. we are actually allowed to practice in the crc in the auxillary gym on the 4th floor some weeknights. it took us about two years to get this practice space, but the problem is that you have to pass a strict test to be able to use that practice range. it takes a person new to archery over 6 moths to succeed.   also, the club has 15-20 nationally certified coaches. so we are well aware of proper procedures and liability. again, i am mostly trying to get a general consensus regarding this idea. we will of course go through proper procedures with crc, gtpd, administration, and legal before we can even consider simply taking over the space.

33wfs5	04/26/2015 07:33	Flacco_EliteDragon	How screwed over would I be if I transferred from Maryland?	when i was applying to college, i dreamed of going to georgia tech and saw it as my clear first-choice school. i was accepted, but ultimately decided to go to my in state school, university of maryland, because of the money. the thing is though that georgia tech is still in my price range and i feel as if it would provide me with a much better engineering education. currently i am a freshman with ~ a 3.7 gpa and 31 credits taken at maryland. transfers at maryland are usually pretty screwed over though in terms of housing, registering for classes and credits transferring over. these three things are the only things holding me back from transferring and i was wondering if they are usually a problem for transfer students here. i really want to go here, and i think about how i made the wrong college decision everyday.

33v0ce	04/25/2015 22:01	MrThundercock	Dear CRC,	i have no problem that you scheduled an elementary-school basketball tournament all day both saturday and sunday that is taking up 4 of the 6 basketball courts, leaving 2 basketball courts for 15,000 undergraduate students + the random family members of the hundreds of kids playing in the tournament.  truly, on this weekend before finals, the most important weekend of the semester, it is a sign of my monumental hubris, arrogance, and unchecked privilege that i would so selfishly expect to be able to relax and engage in physical recreation in a campus facility. as a full time georgia tech student, it is nothing short of laughable that i should waltz into the georgia tech gym and expect to be able to use it. what was i thinking? that i, a georgia tech student paying full fees, have any precedence over young kids at a georgia tech facility i am paying for?  regardless, it's obvious that the management at the crc took great pains to try their hardest to help their students in any way they could on this weekend, the weekend before finals, but this elementary school basketball tournament simply *could not wait*. these are the elite of metro atlanta 5th grade basketball, and to interrupt their international basketball tour by delaying their atlanta tournament by a week, or unthinkably, *two*, is absolutely out of the question.   from the bottom of my heart, i sincerely thank the crc for occasionally not scheduling events that take up the entire basketball courts and letting me, a full-time georgia tech student, use the georgia tech gym, if only once in a while.  --mrthundercock

33n0ve	04/23/2015 21:09	gatechpleasehelp	Psychiatry questions	i've been feeling extremely depressed this semester, and i don't think it is stress related. i've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts before but worked through it on my own, but that 'solution' made me dead inside despite keeping me alive. this semester has been the first time for as long as i can remember where i haven't felt dead inside (and that is great! i actually enjoy things for the first time in forever) but it has come at the cost of wanting to die and being distracted by thoughts of killing myself in varying degrees of intensity and length (there was a good month or so where i was so distracted by it this semester that i learned absolutely nothing in one of my classes throughout that whole time, but other times i feel nothing like that and fully enjoy my time here). i don't want to kill myself and i've decided on a conscious level that killing myself or otherwise dying earlier than my life expectancy would be a negative impact to everyone around me, but these thoughts persist and persist and break me down over and over again.   i want to get help, but i have no desire to speak with friends, family, or my ra about it. i would want to speak with a psychiatrist about these issues, but i want to make sure about a few things before i decide to go to the on campus psychiatric office. i don't want my parents to worry about me anymore than they already do, so i want to make sure that even if i talk about suicidal thoughts at the psychiatric office, they won't notify my parents/the school/whatever. i am also worried about costs that might be incurred by psychiatry sessions. my parents don't have a health insurance plan that covers mental health (and i wouldn't really want to use that plan anyway since they'd be able to see the charges and services) and i am under the impression that we get 2 hours/2 sessions of free counseling a semester as students, so wanted to take advantage of that if it would help me. if the psychiatry here is quality enough to risk them possibly reporting what i say then i will go without hesitation. neither me nor my parents can afford for me to go to many sessions or for me to have a lot of prescription drugs.  because this is something that seems to persist and re-emerge at different times, it would make sense to me that i would be prescribed with antidepressants or the like. this, however, would come into the same issues with the insurance (both that the prescription itself would likely be ridiculously expensive without the right insurance and that the charges if there are any would be known to my parents). if the stamps pharmacy carries antidepressant prescription drugs that i could get without an overly expensive out of pocket, out of insurance charge that would be ideal. i just don't know what i should do.   i want to be clear: i have no intention of killing myself, especially not here at tech, but the thoughts cloud my mind and affect my judgement so i'm scared that i may not be able to hold true to that. i don't believe that these thoughts are being caused by stress from school/finals but stress may be a trigger that causes a cascade of chemical reactions that completely screw my brain chemistry (i don't feel stressed right now, but as i started typing this i was feeling more depressed than i have ever felt before). having some kind of psychological evaluation would help me to better understand what is wrong.  please let me know if you have any information that could help me.  edit:spelling, clarified a thing

33inti	04/22/2015 20:52	IAmABatmanToo	So...weird question about advising appointments	so my advisor is a busy professor.  for whatever reason, he literally never responds to emails; i've sent maybe 30 emails regarding meeting with him since last semester, to which he has responded once (yes, i do have the correct email address). in his response two weeks ago, all he said was that he has office hours on certain days. but there was no way i could meet him during those times...   anyways, i managed to catch him in person. he was busy again, and told me he has office hours tomorrow at a time when i'm actually free. i do have to meet with him urgently.   so finally, the question. can professors hold advising appointments during their regular office hours? has anyone ever just popped into their advisor's office during their office hours and had a legit, spontaneous advising appointment?

33az2p	04/21/2015 01:25	Josahty	Oh God, another transfer question? Yes. I need you guys.	warning: more of a rant than a question. i'm having a tough night and i seriously need encouragement.  first off, i did search a little and didn't find anything terribly useful for *my* particular concerns, so i figured i'd run the risk of looking like a tool for the potential of you fine people being able to help me/make me feel better cause i'm stressing out hardcore this evening.  i'm a junior^don't ^get ^excited at the university of tennessee chattanooga who has dreams of transferring to georgia tech to get a bachelor's and possibly a master's in computer engineering, then hopefully one day be able to work for nasa or spacex. i want to design things for probes because probes are awesome.  i'm obsessed with the dream of going to tech. i'm doing everything in my power at the moment to get myself there. the only transfer requirement i have to fulfill is the calc-based physics course, which i believe i'll be satisfying at utc over the summer. so i'm hoping to transfer in next spring.  thing is...i'm having a difficult time trying to find classes that 100% transfer. it looks like oscar is still considering the utc curriculum from about five to seven years ago, back when we had fewer class...categories(?) and three digit codes instead of four. i've tried to communicate with various people at tech about classes transferring, but i've been told by every one of them either "that's not my department" or they won't be fully evaluated until i apply, which i can't do until august.  i said "don't get excited" about me being a junior because i still have about two years of classes left at utc if i decide to stay here and graduate. i started college late, i'm 25 now, i estimated that i wouldn't graduate from utc until i was 27. i feel old, and i'm seriously worried that transferring to tech will add on another year or more to that.  however...i want to come to tech because i feel like i would be comfortable stopping with a bachelor's from tech, whereas i would definitely not feel comfortable stopping with a bachelor's from utc. i also want to come to tech because i love atlanta, i love the campus, i've taken tours and heard great things, and - bear with me here - i feel like i belong at tech. i love it and i want to be all up inside it. when i took my last tour in march, i felt a sense of belonging.  but when i look at the required courses and all of my courses that may not transfer, i feel a sense of despair on the level of pitt when they committed their fifth fumble. i don't want to be almost 30 when i graduate. but, it's my life's dream to work for nasa or the like because i'm a massive spacenerd, and surely a degree and the connections made from going to tech will help in that, so...  i mean, all i can do right now is take the summer physics class, apply in august, and hope for the best when my transfer credits are evaluated. since that's the best option for getting myself there, that's what i'll do. i'm just the kind of guy who hates uncertainty and wasted time.  thanks for reading. for the swarm!

32zosi	04/18/2015 02:13	forkjoseph	Georgia Tech Android application source code at Github.	hey all,  when i entered tech several years ago, i found the mobile application available at tech is insufficient and decided to create the app that has 1) t-square (mobile friendly) with notification feature, 2) places to eat, 3) campus map with gps feature, 4) reserve a room in culc without login, 5) etc.   though i and others worked hard to deliver the app, we have never made it and i'm about to graduate. thus, i decided to make it opensource for future innovative developers (i have a belief in yellow jacket). the code is somewhat hodgepodge and obsolete but should be straightforward to port new features with better ide (i.e., android studio). i hope that the code may not help you at all but still future passionate developers can take as a reference when starting from a scratch to build an android application.  the source code is available here: https://github.com/forkjoseph/mygatech  you can fork, cook, boil, cut, or whatever you want to do, as long as you can take an advantage of and put small note on contribution section :)   disclaimer: i and others are neither officially related to georgia tech nor responsible for individuals' actions incurred by source code distribution.

32ouvp	04/15/2015 14:54	____yourcouch	My 2	tuition goes up every year is not a valid argument. the way it is does not mean it's the way it should be. so everybody saying deal with it need to clam up.  here's the real issue with the tuition hike: 9% is huge. not only that, but tech is receiving the biggest hike of any school in the university system. other usg schools had as little as a 2.5% hike. we are the best institution in the state, and arguably the best in the southeast. at any rate we're the best engineering school in the southeast. we're the pride of the region and we're paying for it. why should we be burdened further because we've dedicated ourselves to our academics.  i'd much rather pay higher taxes when i graduate than go into more debt to finish my degree.  so here's my proposal: the usg board of regents office is right downtown. we can literally walk there. our student body is plenty big to get some real attention. we should have a sit in strike. walk in the building or sit on the lawn and bring shame on the grey-haired politicians who'd rather push the youth into debt than upset their aging, republican constituency.  usg offices address:  270 washington street, sw  atlanta, ga 30334

32havi	04/13/2015 20:13	p00pwater	Looking for a (possibly) short-term lease, July-September	(i originally posted this in /r/atlanta, and it was suggested that i repost in /r/gatech and /r/gastate.)  i'm a student currently living in midtown. i have two cats (actually one, but during the time of the lease i will also be taking care of a friend's cat) who are both very friendly and widely loved by all. i take very good care of my cats, and any roommates would not have to worry about assuming any responsibility for them.  there's a good chance that, at the end of the summer, i'll move to the bay area, but i also may end up staying in atlanta longer. my current lease in midtown ends at the start of july, and i have obligations in atlanta at least until september, so i can't move when my lease ends. if i do end up leaving, i would totally take responsibility for finding a replacement (subject to your approval, of course).  i work in midtown, and while i have a car, i don't like to drive to work, (parking practically costs as much as rent) so being near marta is important. i really like pretty much any area between i-20 and ponce from midtown out to decatur. (cabbagetown, reynoldstown, inman, l5p, candler, decatur, avondale, kirkwood, etc., or also grant park)  preferably, i'd like to live with other students or young professionals in their 20s who are 420 friendly, laid back, enjoy music, intelligent, etc. i'm not intent on being great friends with my roommates, but being able to hang out now and then is definitely a plus.  by the way, i'm male, but i'm open to people of any gender (and i do actually mean any, not "both"). i've lived with women many times before, and frankly the roommates i've had the fewest conflicts with have been unanimously non-male.  my price range would be to go as high $600/mo, but that can vary depending on location (since location will effect how much i need to spend on transportation, too).  i'm open to a group of people/person in an apartment or house with a roommate who is leaving, or a group of people/person who are looking for a place and seeking an additional roommate to join.

32ewji	04/13/2015 05:53	allbogeyaverage	Questions about CS MS at GA Tech	hey everybody - i was recently accepted into the fall 2015 program at ga tech for a master's in cs. i know ga tech is a great school for computer science but noticed the department was huge, and as a consequence of that the staff takes a long time to get back to me.   my biggest issue is that i'm obviously not from georgia, and attending tech has projected me going into some debt, around $30-40k. i have been emailing the graduate coordinator for the program but the replies come usually five to seven business days later, and the last conversation i had they neglected half of the questions i asked and it was very obvious some of the information was copy-pasted (i don't blame them for that, but i did have pressing concerns). no scholarship information has been sent my way even though i applied before the priority deadline, and assistantships are generally not available until the second semester "at a 60/40 chance" or so says the grad coordinator.  i'm a bit concerned, as my undergraduate degree is in physics (although i have a cs minor and more cs electives on top of that) and i feel like getting on board with a professor fast enough to try to get a ga in time to not go into debt might not work well.  the deadline for me to accept their offer of admission is this wednesday, and i have my graduate school decision narrowed down between ga tech and an in-state school, ut chattanooga. the latter obvious doesn't have as an established department, but also won't put me into debt, is closer to home, and is more familiar. i've read things on the subreddit about the atmosphere in the cs department and frankly the size concerns me, especially when i would want to try for a ga. and of course, an ms really only matters for that first job, so i would want tech to provide a better springboard than my other options  anyways, long story short - what are your two cents? i'm not asking any of you to tell me what to do, but rather shed on light on what i could expect going to grad school and how easy or hard it might be to try to not go into debt. i know nothing about scholarships or tuition waivers as the school is communicating with me at a snail's pace, so right now i have to look at the worst-case scenario of only going into it with my savings.   edit: thank you all for your replies so far, they have been a big help.   final edit: thank you all very much for your input. help from here at /r/gatech as well as /r/utc has made it clear that ga tech is path i want to take. you've all been a great help and i look forward to attending this fall!

BME or MSE?	before you say to major in whichever i'm interested in more, please hear me out!   i have thoroughly explored both majors and figured that i would enjoy them both. i have always wanted to to bme, but recently i have started to have doubts when i learned that they changed the curriculum, eliminating bmed 1000 and making bmed 2210 the first pre-req course that freshman take. did they do this to weed even more people out as bme is becoming a popular major at tech? also, i have been browsing critique.gatech.edu and "the bme unofficial course guide" pdf, and i'm kind of scared by the very low average gpas for some courses. and having a high gpa is necessary to be competitive for med school admissions. that said, i still am very interested in  and would love to do research in this field.   mse interests me because i like applied chemistry and applied physics. i know it's one of the uncommon engineering majors at tech and probably a rare pre-med major. since it's a relatively small major, would it necessarily be easier to develop closer bonds with the professors and potentially help them with their research?  as of now, i want to go into medicine, but that could change, which is why i do not plan to major in a science. i feel that a degree in engineering would be a marketable fallback.   i appreciate insight from any and every gt student/alum, not just bmes and mses. thanks so much!

31dlp6	04/04/2015 01:43	oisdfiosdjf9292	What is with the bus routes?	it seems like the bus routes are intentionally laid out to be as bad as possible, so i feel like there has to be some reason.  like for instance there are several bus stops right after a stop light, so buses end up stopping at red lights, then going like 30 feet just to stop again at the bus stop.    then there are the bus stops right before crosswalks so the bus has to wait for people to cross and people crossing can't see the road because the bus is in the way.  and the drivers take breaks at the crc stop when they sit for 10 minutes at fitten hall which is one stop away, why can't these be combined?  these just make so little sense it seems like it has to have been planned like this.

(georgepburdell@gatech.edu and gburdell3@gatech.edu are the same account)  step three: make amazon id with your alias (georgepburdell@gatech.edu)  step four: free amazon prime for 6 months. enjoy  step five: amazon prime runs out. before they auto-charge you for a renewal, delete that account  step six: make new alias  step seven: repeat from step three till you graduate  step eight: now that you've graduated and cant make more aliases, use your original email (gburdell3@gatech.edu in my case)  i don't use it myself since i have used my alias on resumes and to apply for research positions and i can't delete it without missing future emails sent to it.  if i had used gburdell3@gatech.edu to apply for jobs/research, i could have used this trick.

(marta, morningside, rock springs...?) if so, does the shuttle run at a normal pace, or long stops at each? and finally, do you have to show that you're cross enrolled of dual whateverness to ride?   thanks!

3133hz	04/01/2015 17:55	PokeSalad	Thoughts on ECON 2101?	3.29 average gpa on course critique, and it'll count as a global perspectives course. still though, i thought i'd ask for people's personal experiences with the class.

Does this mean it's not being taught in Atlanta next Fall?	when i try to register it gives me the red text and says my attempt was denied due to a "campus restriction". does this mean this class isn't being taught in atlanta next fall? under the "attributes" column for the class, it lists "grvs, insy, tces." i don't know what this means and i've never seen it before.

30yh04	03/31/2015 18:55	whyamihereyo	Question about switching majors from Aerospace to Civil Engineering	hey guys. i've been contemplating changing my major to civil engineering, but i just don't know if it's an actual possibility for me. obviously i will talk to my adviser, but i haven't had the time to talk to them recently.   background: i'm a second year student finishing my 4th semester. i've taken most of my core classes, and so far i have only taken 2 aerospace specific courses (intro, and low speed which i'm currently taking). i received a b in intro, and i'm currently struggling between a b and a c in low speed. i currently have a gpa of 3.46, but that's most likely going to drop below 3.3 after this semester. edit:(a bit more background) i came to tech as an undecided, so i only chose ae at the start of last semester. so far in my 2 ae courses, i find the material very interesting, but it takes me an unnatural amount of time to understand it as well as to get motivated to actually learn it. i knew i would choose between ae and civil since i got here, but recently i've started to think that maybe civil would have been a better fit for me.  i'm asking anyone here who has gone through this process, not only if it's worth it for me to change at this point, but if it's a dumb move given all the things one has to consider when changing majors. thanks in advance.
